# APK_RELEASE

Welcome to the APK_RELEASE repository — the central place for preparing, storing, and releasing Android APKs for the entire project collection.

This repository holds release artifacts, packaging notes, and release automation helpers for Android applications maintained under the main organization. It's designed to be the single authoritative source for APK distribution and release-related metadata.

Why this repo exists
- Centralized APK artifacts: keep signed and unsigned APKs organized by app and release tag.
- Release automation: store CI scripts, signing configs, and helper tools for releasing builds.
- Audit & traceability: maintain a clear changelog and release notes alongside binary artifacts.

Quick start
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/sirius54817/APK_RELEASE.git`
2. Add your APKs into a directory named after the app and version (for example `MyApp/v1.2.3/`).
3. Add a short release note file `RELEASE_NOTES.md` alongside the APK explaining notable changes and signing steps.

Best practices
- Never commit unencrypted signing keys to this repo. Use a secure secrets manager (CI secrets, HashiCorp Vault, etc.).
- Keep a `signed/` and `unsigned/` subfolder per release to avoid accidental overwrites.
- Prefer storing checksums (`SHA256SUMS`) next to artifacts for integrity verification.

Contributing
- Open an issue to propose changes to release procedures.
- Use branches and PRs for changelog updates or automation improvements.

License & security
- This repo may contain binary artifacts; handle them according to your org's security policy.

Have fun releasing — and keep builds reproducible!
